# Exoplanet Transit Photometry for TESS Planetary Candidates TOI-4439.01 & TOI-5278.01

This is my course project for **Observational Astronomy**.

## Abstract

The [Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS)](https://www.google.com.hk/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwi0s6Kvw9L4AhWmJkQIHXMnBZQQFnoECEAQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Ftess.mit.edu%2F&usg=AOvVaw3aNzy_Fm27FsBL0Bx1mrH1) is an all-sky survey mission led by MIT and NASA in search of exoplanets. A certain number of planet candidates (PC) discovered by TESS are not actual transiting exoplanets, which are usually referred as "false positives", therefore astronomers need follow-up ground based photometry to verify the exoplanet nature of TESS PCs. In this paper, we conduct ground-based transit photometry on two planets candidates declared in TESS, TOI-5278.01 and TOI-4439.01 with an 80cm telescope at [Xinglong Observatory](http://chjaa.bao.ac.cn/html/index.html), P.R. China. Our data processing pipeline comprises of three parts: image reduction, aperture photometry and EXOFAST fit. For TOI-4439.01, our result is in accordance with TESS data, proving the exoplanet nature, while the EXOFAST fit did not converge for TOI-5278.01 due to low SNR of the light curve.
